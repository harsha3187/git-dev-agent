## 📓 Jupyter Notebook: `semantic-kernel-chat-agent.ipynb`

### Purpose
The  notebook provides an interactive environment to explore and experiment with the Semantic Kernel framework. It demonstrates how to use Semantic Kernel to build intelligent, context-aware chat agents and plugins for interacting with GitHub repositories.

### Features
- **Introduction to Semantic Kernel**:
  - Overview of key concepts like Kernel, Plugins, Agents, Chat Completion, and Vector Stores.
- **Chat Completion Service**:
  - Demonstrates how to create and interact with a chat completion service using Azure OpenAI.
- **Chat Completion Agent**:
  - Explains the difference between a chat completion service and an agent, and how to create an agent for context-aware interactions.
- **GitHub Plugin**:
  - Shows how to create a plugin to interact with the GitHub API for tasks like retrieving repository details, managing issues, and analyzing commits.
- **Practical Examples**:
  - Includes examples of querying user profiles, describing repositories, listing issues, and analyzing commits.

## 🔑 Setting Up Azure OpenAI Endpoint and Keys

Follow these steps to create an Azure OpenAI endpoint and keys for GPT-4.1:

### 1. Create an Azure OpenAI Resource
1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Search for **Azure OpenAI** in the search bar and select **Azure OpenAI**.
3. Click **Create** to start creating a new resource.
4. Fill in the required details:
   - **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription.
   - **Resource Group**: Create a new resource group or select an existing one.
   - **Region**: Choose a supported region (e.g., East US, West Europe).
   - **Name**: Provide a unique name for your OpenAI resource.
5. Click **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

### 2. Deploy a GPT-4.1 Model
1. Navigate to your newly created Azure OpenAI resource.
2. Go to the **Model Deployments** section in the left-hand menu.
3. Click **Create** to deploy a new model.
4. Select the **GPT-4.1** model from the list.
5. Provide a **Deployment Name** (e.g., `gpt-4.1`) and configure the model settings as needed.
6. Click **Deploy** to start the deployment process.

### 3. Retrieve Endpoint and API Key
1. Once the deployment is complete, go to the **Keys and Endpoint** section in your Azure OpenAI resource.
